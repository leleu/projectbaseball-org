            <blockquote>
              <p>The modern game of baseball is deeply informed by data.
              However, the steep learning curve limits how fans can engage with the sport.</p>
              <p>This site aims to soften the learning curve, so a modern fan can run their own analysis.
              Run your first analysis in under 10 minutes, then continue to learn in-demand data science skills.</p>

            <p>
              Baseball data (fielding, xstats, transactions, game logs, PitchF/X, and more) is automatically
              pulled in by our army of data bots.  Connect your Yahoo account, and we'll pull in your league data.
              Then, step-by-step, we'll teach you how to analyze your fantasy league for fun and profit.

            <h3 class="text-center">Start Immediately</h3>
            <p>We've set up the servers and grabbed the data.  You just need to practice and learn.
              80% of data science is just getting the data ready (ETL) and the servers provisioned (DataOps).
              You'll be running your first baseball analysis in 10 minutes.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Learn by Doing</h3>
            <p>When you learn by doing, the material will seem easier as you see immediate progress.
                You'll build technical skills for working either in baseball
                or elsewhere in a data scientist role.  End up with a customized league analysis of your
                fantasy team, built by you.</p>
