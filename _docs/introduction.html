<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>We are working on the data acquistion and servers.  Launch is scheduled for Winter '18.</p>

<p>This course aims to teach anyone win their fantasy league by running their own analyses, using Python and SQL.  Focus on the baseball analysis; we will provide the data and tools necessary to get started.</p>

<p>Programming is best learned by doing.  We have removed upfront obstacles like data access or installing software so you can focus on exercises.  The course is designed around these exercises, but you should be exploring on your own.  For example: when we show you how to identify the players with the biggest disagreement between fWAR and bWAR, you should try a similar approach for DRS and UZR.</p>
