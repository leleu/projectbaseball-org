<h3>The Billy Hamilton Question</h3>
<p>As daily leagues become more popular, and leagues become more competitive, fantasy players need to look for competitive edges.
The next arena is for advanced players to run their own analysis, on their own leagues.</p>
<p>To win, it's imperative to understand how specific league settings affect player valuation.  How much is Billy Hamitlon really worth in your league?</p>
<h3>Sophisticated Alerts</h3>
<p>It'd be great to know which streamers have the best matchup.  Or be able to sneak a few extra saves, because you streamed RP when the main closer had pitched a few nights in a row.  Or know which of today's SP are the worst against the SB, so you can stream for steals.</p>
<p>Expected to launch September 30, 2018.</p>
