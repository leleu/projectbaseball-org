<p>Baseball-Reference.com version of WAR is commonly referred to as bWAR.  It's often compared to Fangraphs's WAR calculation.</p>
<h3>bWAR versus fWAR</h3>
<p>Baseball-Reference WAR (bWAR) is different than fWAR in some minor details, and one big one. Baseball Reference's WAR (bWAR) uses ERA.  fWAR uses an ERA-scaled TTO estimated called Fielding Independent Pitching, a metric that strips factors outside the pitcher's control.  Pitchers who outperform their FIP will have less bWAR than fWAR.
