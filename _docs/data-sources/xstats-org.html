<p>xStats.org is a data source that uses exit velocity, launch angle, and other inputs to estimate the results of similarly struck balls.</p>
<p>E.g., if a batter hits the ball with a 98mph exit velocity and a 42% launch angle to left-left-center, how often is that a single/double/triple/homer/out, across all the batted balls in the game.</p>
<p>Expected to launch September 23, 2018.</p>
