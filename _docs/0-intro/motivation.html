<p>Baseball analysis is fun.  I love reading fangraphs.com and sharpening my understanding and appreciation for the game of baseball.</p>
<p>However, I always want to find answers to my own set of questions.  Things that will help in fantasy.  Which players are outperforming their peripherals?  Would my team do better if I picked up a bottom-tier closer, or should I pick up a mid-tier SP?  How "real" is Franmil Reyes' performance?</p>
<p>Project Baseball wants to teach you to answer your own questions.  So we're doing boring work for you: prepare all the data you want in a queryable format.  You can use our servers to access the data, so you don't need to worry about installing MySQL, creating databases, and connecting to it.  You can just focus on the analysis.</p>
