<p>Teach anyone win their fantasy league by running their own analyses, using Python and SQL.  Focus on the baseball analysis; we will provide the data, infrastructure, and course material necessary to get started.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Compare different measures from different systems (bWAR vs. fWAR)</li>
	<li>Analyze your fantasy league teams and trends</li>
	<li>Build objective measure of player value for your league (SGP)</li>
	<li>Compare players based on your league settings</li>
	<li>Build your own player projection system, like ZiPS or PECOTA</li>
</ol>


<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Programming is best learned by doing.  We have removed upfront obstacles  so you can focus on exercises.  The course is designed around these exercises, but you should be exploring on your own.  For example: when we show you how to identify the players with the biggest disagreement between fWAR and bWAR, you should try a similar approach for DRS and UZR.</p>


<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
